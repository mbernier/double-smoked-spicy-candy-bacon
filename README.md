# Double Smoked Spicy Candy Bacon

## Ingredients

* 1lb Super Thick Cut Bacon
* Brown Sugar
* Cayenne Pepper

## Directions

Fire up your smoker or grill. Get it nice and smoky with very few embers that can or will light on fire when delicious bacon grease kisses their edges. Bacon burns quickly and angels cry when this happens.

Lay the bacon on the grill surface. Spread brown sugar on the bacon. Sprinkle the bacon with cayenne - to your spicy preference. Wait till the bacon is awesome.

Eat the bacon candy.

*This is double smoked, because bacon is smoked at least once before you buy it.
